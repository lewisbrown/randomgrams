Randomgrams
===========

Usage: ./bin/randomgrams <number>

<number> is an integer used to generate a random character string of that
length.

Randomgrams then finds and prints the English anagrams based on the generated string.

NB: the program assumes a standard Linux installation with an English
dictionary file located at /usr/share/dict/words.
